## Development Rules & Guidelines

### 🌐 Documentation-First Rule (CRITICAL)

**Before implementing ANY new feature or using ANY new tool/library:**

- [ ] ALWAYS browse the internet to find the most updated documentation
- [ ] Verify you're using the latest stable version of the tool/library
- [ ] Check for breaking changes, deprecated methods, or new best practices
- [ ] Use Context7, official documentation sites, and GitHub repositories for verification
- [ ] Document the version numbers and sources used in implementation comments

### 🌍 Internationalization Rule (CRITICAL)

**ALL new visual elements with text MUST have translations:**

- [ ] MANDATORY: Import `useTranslations` from "next-intl" in any component with user-facing text
- [ ] MANDATORY: Use translation keys instead of hardcoded strings (e.g., `{t("connect")}` instead of "Connect Wallet")
- [ ] MANDATORY: Follow existing translation namespace patterns (e.g., "Shared.componentName", "Pages.pageName")
- [ ] MANDATORY: All buttons, labels, titles, descriptions, error messages, and tooltips must be translatable
- [ ] MANDATORY: Test components with different locales to ensure proper text rendering
- [ ] CRITICAL: This platform is international - no hardcoded English text is acceptable in production
- [ ] Add translation keys to the appropriate locale files when creating new text elements
- [ ] Use descriptive translation keys that indicate the context (e.g., "walletConnectionButton.connect" not just "connect")

### 🔍 Codebase Integration Rule (CRITICAL)

**Before integrating ANY new feature or component:**

- [ ] ALWAYS examine existing implementations in the target directories first
- [ ] Check `/src/components/` for similar UI components that can be extended
- [ ] Review `/src/hooks/` for existing patterns and naming conventions
- [ ] Analyze `/src/lib/` for utility functions that can be reused or extended
- [ ] Inspect `/src/stores/` for state management patterns and integration points
- [ ] Look at `/src/utils/` for helper functions and type definitions
- [ ] Review existing `/src/sections/` for layout and structure patterns
- [ ] Check `/src/app/` for routing and provider integration patterns
- [ ] Ensure new code follows existing architectural decisions and patterns
- [ ] Avoid duplicating functionality that already exists in the codebase

**Both rules apply to:**

- Solana wallet adapters and Web3.js implementations
- Next.js 15 and React 19 specific features
- TypeScript configurations and best practices
- UI library updates (HeroUI, TailwindCSS)
- Smart contract interaction patterns
- Security best practices for wallet integration

## Current Status: COMPLETE WALLET SYSTEM OVERHAUL ✅

### 2025 Modern Wallet Architecture Implementation (2025-01-27)
