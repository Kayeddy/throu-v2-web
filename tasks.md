### Implementation Details

The wallet detection issue was caused by:

1. Hardcoded `isInstalled: false` in SolanaWalletModal
2. Relying solely on wallet adapter readyState instead of browser detection
3. No proper async wallet injection handling

**Solution implemented:**

1. Browser-based wallet detection using window object inspection
2. Async wallet injection waiting with timeout
3. Proper installation status checking
4. User-friendly install prompts only when wallets are actually not installed
