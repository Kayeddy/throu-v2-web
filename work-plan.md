## Dual-Chain Implementation Plan (URGENT DELIVERY)

### First Delivery: Dual-Chain Core Infrastructure

**Priority: HIGH**
**Timeline: 4 days**
**Estimated time: 14 hours**

**Tasks:**

- Create Solana connection module alongside existing Polygon infrastructure
- Implement chain detection and switching functionality for Polygon and Solana
- Develop cross-chain abstraction layer for unified data handling
- Setup chain-specific environment variables and configurations
- Implement chain metadata storage and retrieval system
- Enhance existing Polygon integration with Solana compatibility
- Develop Solana network connection handling

**Delivery plan:**
Implementation of the core infrastructure to enable the platform to support both Polygon and Solana networks. Leveraging the existing Polygon integration as a foundation, we'll create a flexible architecture that allows for seamless interaction with both chains. This foundation is critical for all subsequent dual-chain functionality.

**Technical Focus:**

- Developing a frontend chain-agnostic data model that works with both EVM and Solana Program models
- Creating client-side adapter patterns to unify transaction formats across both chains
- Implementing frontend cross-chain state synchronization mechanisms

**Billing:**

- Estimated time: 14 hours
- Hourly rate: 65,000 COP
- Total: 910,000 COP

**Objective:** Complete the dual-chain infrastructure within 4 days (accelerated timeline).

### Second Delivery: Wallet Integration & Chain Switching

**Priority: HIGH**
**Timeline: 3 days**
**Estimated time: 12 hours**

**Tasks:**

- Extend RainbowKit configuration to prepare for Solana integration
- Adapt existing wagmi hooks to work alongside Solana connections
- Implement unified wallet state management across both chains
- Add chain validation for transactions on both networks
- Implement error handling for Solana and Polygon-specific issues
- Integrate Phantom wallet support for Solana connections
- Create automated network adding functionality for both chains

**Delivery plan:**
Extend the existing RainbowKit wallet infrastructure to support Solana through Phantom wallet integration. This phase focuses on the technical challenges of maintaining a unified wallet state across two fundamentally different blockchain architectures (EVM vs. Solana's Program model), requiring significant frontend development to provide a seamless experience across chains.

**Technical Focus:**

- Building adapters between RainbowKit/wagmi and Solana wallet standards

- Update transaction modals to show chain-specific information
- Implement chain indicators throughout the UI
- Update project data fetching to handle both chains
- Create network switching prompts specific to Polygon and Solana
- Optimize gas estimation for Polygon and transaction fee handling for Solana

**Delivery plan:**
Develop a unified frontend system for interacting with smart contracts on both Polygon and Solana, and update the user interface to reflect dual-chain functionality. This is the most complex part of the implementation, requiring deep knowledge of both Polygon's EVM-compatible contracts and Solana's Program interfaces to create a cohesive user experience, with all logic implemented in the frontend.

**Technical Focus:**

- Building a client-side unified transaction formatting system that works across both chains
- Implementing frontend error handling for chain-specific transaction failures

  **Total estimated cost:** 5,500,000 COP (84.6 total hours)

**Project Value Justification:**
This accelerated dual-chain implementation is being executed under significant time constraints, requiring intensive focus, extended work hours, and prioritization over other projects. The project's value is based on:

- Technical complexity of integrating Solana with existing Polygon infrastructure in a frontend-only approach
- After-hours development to meet the urgent delivery schedule
- The high-value nature of enabling dual-chain functionality
- Professional expertise with consistent 65,000 COP hourly rate across all work

**Revision policy:**
Due to the accelerated timeline, each delivery will include 1 revision cycle within 24 hours of delivery. Additional revisions will be addressed after the full implementation is complete and may incur additional costs.

// Supported chain configuration
interface ChainConfig {
  chainId: number | string; // String for Solana
  name: string;
  rpcUrl: string;
  blockExplorer: string;
  iconUrl: string;
  nativeCurrency: {
    name: string;
    symbol: string;
    decimals: number;
  };
}

// Chain-specific contract addresses
interface ContractAddresses {
  [chainId: string]: {
    [contractName: string]: string;
  };
}

// Cross-chain transaction tracking
interface CrossChainTransaction {
  id: string;
  type: "TRANSFER" | "SWAP" | "INVESTMENT";
  sourceChain: "polygon" | "solana";
  sourceAddress: string;
  destinationChain: "polygon" | "solana";
  destinationAddress: string;
  amount: string;
  status: "PENDING" | "COMPLETED" | "FAILED";
  timestamp: number;
}

// Solana-specific connection handler
interface SolanaConnectionConfig {
  endpoint: string;
  commitment: "processed" | "confirmed" | "finalized";
  wsEndpoint?: string;
}
```

### Supported Blockchain Networks:

1. **Polygon** (Already integrated)
2. **Solana** (To be implemented)

This dual-chain integration will enable users to invest, view, and manage their assets across both Polygon and Solana from a single coherent interface. Initially implemented entirely in the frontend, this solution leverages Polygon's EVM compatibility and Solana's high-speed, low-cost transactions to provide users with flexibility and optimal performance. The architecture is designed to allow for potential future migration of key components to a dedicated backend service as needed.
